I have been doing freelance work for a while now, but recently I came to the
conclusion that I wanted to be more than just a lone gunslinger, and in fact
*needed* to be, in order to do larger projects.

So now it's official! I'm excited to announce that I have founded a new
software development consulting firm: [OK, GROW!](http://okgrow.com).
We build and support quality web and mobile apps.

I only have one question when making a decision like this: "how does it benefit
my clients?". If it's not something that helps me provide a better service,
then it's a bad idea. In this case the answer was clear: a team can do much
more than a lone freelancer, and hiring awesome developers and designers and
letting them work their magic with me allows me to do so much more for my
clients.

For now it's just myself and [Robert Lowe](https://twitter.com/#!/_RobertLowe),
who is one of the best (and fastest!!) developers I've had the pleasure of
working with. Staying small and lean is the plan!

So please take a look at [our new site](http://okgrow.com) and [tweet about
it](http://twitter.com/share?url=http://okgrow.com/&text=%22OK,%20grow!%22,%20a%20new%20Ruby%20and%20JavaScript%20development%20shop%20in%20Toronto!)
if you think it's good that Toronto has a new option for Ruby and JavaScript
development.

And please [get in touch](http://okgrow.com/#contact) if you have a project
that you'd like to discuss with us!
